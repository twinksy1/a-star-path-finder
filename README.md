# A* Shortest Path Algorithm
> This is a graphical application coded in C++ using the X11 framework to render the behavior of the A* shortest path algorithm.
# Features
* Left-click to select a node which will represent the starting node
* Right-click (shift + left-click) to select a node which will represent the ending node
* Press 'f' to let the algorithm find the shortest path between the two nodes
* Shortest path will be highlighted in white
* Press 'c' to clear the path and resume clicking on nodes
* If no path is possible, no path is highlighted and a message appears on the top of the window
